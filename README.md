# Archival for all Competitive Programming and DSA programs

This repository corresponds to all the programs written by me for various contests, algorithmic tasks on platforms like LeetCode,
Codeforces, Atcoder, Codechef, Hackerrank etc. These programs have minimal to zero documentation but I will try to add the editorial
later for the programs in text files.

Some predefined conventions (which I will obviously violate like Drake did to the kids) : 

	- Each platform will have its own designated folder (namely `leetcode`, `codeforces`, `codechef`, `atcoder`, `hackerrank`, `tuf` and more 
	to be added as and when required)
	- Inside each folder the `misc` folder should contain the solutions to the problems which I'm solving outside of a contest for practice, 
	and all such programs will be inside the `misc` folder. For example if problem 6969A of `codeforces` was solved outside of its parent contest, 
	then it shall be `codeforces/misc/6969A.cpp`. For the `tuf` folder, programs shall be organised as per their sheets/topics.
	- Problems are not necessarily solved using one language, althought the order of preference for solving is C++ > Java > Python. The 
	templates for C++ and Java are to be found as `template.cpp` and `Solution.java` at the root directory (same as this README.md).
	- Compiler flags and compilation commands shall optionally be included. 
	- For contests, every contest has an ID/mnemonic name (Weekly Contest 69 or Div 4 contest 420) and the directories corresponding to the 
	contests shall be named accordingly as well. For example if I participate in Weekly Contest 69 of Leetcode then the programs corresponding
	to that contest shall be found at `leetcode/weekly69`. Executable files, pyc files, .class files are not committed to VCS for obvious reasons.
	- Regarding upsolving, the corresponding contest directories shall contain a directory named `upsolve` inside them which shall contain the 
	programs written after upsolving the same. 
	- If you have any problems/clarifications regarding these, feel free to mail [here](mailto:aritroshomework@gmail.com) but note that competitive
	programming isn't my #1 priority hence replies/clarifications can be slow.


 Programming Environment:
 	- Windows 11 Home Edition
 	- GCC/G++ from [this website](https://winlibs.com) because it's very easy to setup (download the zip corresponding to your system,
 	extract it and place it on the PATH environment variable)
 	- Java from OpenJDK releases, NOT Oracle. Don't want legal issues.
 	- Python (either managed by anaconda or from the official website)
 	- Editor: [Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/), ocassionally VsCode/VSCodium + Integrated Terminal
 	- Terminal: Windows Terminal 
 	- Browser: Firefox + uBlock Origin or Opera
 	- Device: HP 240 G8 Laptop (Intel i3 13th Generation, 8GB DDR5 RAM, Intel UHD Graphics, 512GB SSD) or HP Omen 16 (AMD Ryzen 7 7000 Series, 
 	32GB 5600MHz Crucial DDR5 RAM, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 with 8GB GDDR6 VRAM, AMD Radeon Integrated Graphics, NPU Compute Accelerator, 1TB SSD)
