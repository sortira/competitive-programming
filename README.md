# üß† Competitive Programming & DSA Archival

Welcome to my personal archive of all Competitive Programming (CP) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) programs. This repository includes code I've written for contests and problems from platforms like:

- LeetCode
- Codeforces
- AtCoder
- CodeChef
- HackerRank
- TUF Sheets (and more as needed)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Most of these programs contain minimal to zero documentation. I do plan to add editorials in separate text files later, time permitting.

## üìÅ Folder Structure & Conventions

Some loosely followed (and oftenly violated like Drake with kids) organizational rules:

- **Each platform** has its own folder:
  ```
  leetcode/
  codeforces/
  codechef/
  atcoder/
  hackerrank/
  tuf/
  ```

- **`misc/` folders** inside each platform contain practice problems not tied to any contest.  
  Example: `codeforces/misc/6969A.cpp` (solved independently).

- **`tuf/` folder** is organized by sheets or topics, in alignment with the popular DSA sheets.

- **Language preference**:  
  `C++ > Java > Python` (but sometimes I just use what I feel like).  
  Language templates:
  - `template.cpp`
  - `Solution.java`  
  *(found in the root directory)*

- **Contests**:  
  Each contest has its own directory named by its ID/mnemonic.  
  Example:  
  - LeetCode Weekly Contest 69 ‚Üí `leetcode/weekly69/`
  - Codeforces Div 4 Round 420 ‚Üí `codeforces/div4_420/`

- **Upsolving**:  
  Each contest folder can contain an `upsolve/` subfolder for problems solved *after* the contest.

- **Compiled artifacts** (`.exe`, `.class`, `.pyc`) are *not* tracked in version control.
